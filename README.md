# The Compendium

The Compendium is a database for storing contacts and their related information. The design is inspired by minimalism and skeuomorphism.

## Getting Started

From the root directory:
1. Run "npm install"
2. Run "npm run seed"
3. To start the app, either run "npm run build" then "npm start" OR run "npm run backend" and "npm run develop" in tandem

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the app connected to the build folter

### `npm run develop`

You will also need ro run "npm run develop" to start the development server

### `npm run backend`

Runs the express server in development mode
The page will reload if you make edits

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
